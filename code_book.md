# Data Cleaning assignment #1
The data provided to us was broken out into several files.  We will be utilizing the information from 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set' which was originally gathered at University of California Irvine.  It was a study in which 30 people between the ages of 19-48 were given a smart phone and the g-force of their activites was recorded over a variety of activites.

##Original Codebook Addendum
This project extracts and analyses data from the original 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set'.  This was originally downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  The original data and codebook are available as part of this project.


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- code_book.md
- readme.md - File describing the usage of this program
- run_analysis.R - File with R programming code to combine and anaylse the data provided
- UCI HAR Dataset - Full/Original dataset the application will work against.
